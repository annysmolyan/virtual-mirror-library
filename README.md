## How to create glasses mask

To apply a glasses mask, you need to create it in PNG format with transparent background using special overlay base mask.

In this library you can take an example of a such PSD here:

```
   _documentation/fixtures/overlay.psd
```

Open the file (Photoshop or Gimp is required).

You will see several layers with images and also one black layer with name "Background-with-nose-center"
and the other with name "overlay":

![]( _documentation/_images/mask1.png)

If you want to make a new mask, then first of all, hide all layers except for "overlay":

![]( _documentation/_images/mask2.png)

Copy and paste a new PNG glasses image with transparent background. Resize the image according to the mask basic layer:

![]( _documentation/_images/mask3.png)


To be sure that glasses are applied to the nose center, enable the last layer, align the center of glasses
with the white dot on the layer:

![]( _documentation/_images/mask5.png)

When the position is OK, hide all the layers except for glasses:

Then export as "png" this image.

Now the image is ready to be used as mask glasses!
